Due to some technical issue between Github and Andriod Studioï¼Œ many times we have to force push to complete the upload.
Flight search funct was originally committed and pushed by Kexiang Xu(denniseatsfries).
After several times of others' push, Kexiang's files were hidden and Henry Weng helped Kexiang to commit it one more time 
since Henry is the creator of the repo. 
Even though commit history says Kexiang(denniseatsfries) authored the contribution and Henry commited it,
it is still finished by Kexiang individually.
